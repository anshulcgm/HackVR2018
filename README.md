# HackVR2018

This project was made for Seattle VR Hackathon VIII during September 2018. My team made an Mixed Reality game for the Magic Leap Headset in which the player was a dragon, whose goal is to go to various villages and destroy the huts and the villagers. Our team won the First Leap prize for the most innovative Magic Leap Experience.

I was responsible for horizontal plane finding in order to instantiate the dragon and the various villages in a real environment.
